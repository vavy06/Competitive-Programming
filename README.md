# Competitive-Programming
Here i will add some interesting problems under specified topic that i solve on online judges.   

Only the problems in which i encounter some new idea , or i find interesting , shall be added.

I will also add source codes to some problems (may be not complete program but only relevant part).
Link to the code part is given after the problem link. However , you should only check that out in case you are really stuck for a while .


Geometry :
*  https://acm.timus.ru/problem.aspx?space=1&num=1084   
   (easy geometry ; use pi = acos(-1)  )
 
 
 Games :
 *  https://acm.timus.ru/problem.aspx?space=1&num=1023
   ( watch out what are the numbers that you would like second player to be  on ? )
  * https://acm.timus.ru/problem.aspx?space=1&num=1180   (again easy )
  
  
  DP :
